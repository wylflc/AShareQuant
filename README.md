# AShareQuant

AShareQuant is a research and data-analysis project for listed companies in mainland China and Hong Kong equity markets.

The project is intended to support a reproducible equity-research workflow: build an investable universe, identify companies worth following based on durable business quality, collect market and fundamental data, and keep the analysis auditable over time.

## Scope

- Build and maintain universes for A-share and Hong Kong listed securities.
- Distinguish listed companies from their tradable securities, share classes, exchanges, and identifiers.
- Screen listed companies for durable business advantages before any valuation decision.
- Track watchlists as research outputs, not as buy recommendations.
- Collect historical market data including daily open, high, low, close, volume, and related trading fields.
- Track corporate actions such as dividends, splits, bonus shares, rights issues, and other events that affect historical comparability.
- Collect financial report data and disclosure timelines, including forecast, pre-announcement, and official announcement dates where available.

## Principles

- Keep raw source records separate from normalized data and derived signals.
- Preserve data provenance: provider, retrieval time, raw identifier, exchange, currency, reporting period, and adjustment policy.
- Treat trading calendars, suspensions, corporate actions, and identifier mapping as first-class data concerns.
- Keep business-quality screening separate from valuation assessment.
- Avoid committing credentials, paid-data access details, cookies, or private account identifiers.
