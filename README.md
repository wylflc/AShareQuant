# AShareQuant

AShareQuant is a research and data-analysis project for listed companies in mainland China and Hong Kong equity markets.

The project is intended to support a reproducible equity-research workflow: build an investable universe, identify companies worth following based on durable business quality, collect market and fundamental data, and keep the analysis auditable over time.

## Scope

- Build and maintain universes for A-share and Hong Kong listed securities.
- Distinguish listed companies from their tradable securities, share classes, exchanges, and identifiers.
- Screen listed companies for durable business advantages before any valuation decision.
- Track watchlists as research outputs, not as buy recommendations.
- Collect historical market data including daily open, high, low, close, volume, and related trading fields.
- Track corporate actions such as dividends, splits, bonus shares, rights issues, and other events that affect historical comparability.
- Collect financial report data and disclosure timelines, including forecast, pre-announcement, and official announcement dates where available.

## Principles

- Keep raw source records separate from normalized data and derived signals.
- Preserve data provenance: provider, retrieval time, raw identifier, exchange, currency, reporting period, and adjustment policy.
- Treat trading calendars, suspensions, corporate actions, and identifier mapping as first-class data concerns.
- Keep business-quality screening separate from valuation assessment.
- Avoid committing credentials, paid-data access details, cookies, or private account identifiers.

## Project Docs

- `AGENTS.md` contains repository-specific instructions for coding agents.
- `CONTEXT.md` defines the stable domain language used by the project.
- `.agents/skills/equity-research-workflow/SKILL.md` contains reusable workflow guidance for future agent work in this repository.

## Development Workflow

Read the project docs before making changes. After modifying files, run the most targeted useful local check available and commit the completed change batch. Do not push to a remote unless explicitly requested.

## Scripts

Fetch the current mainland China A-share security universe:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_a_share_universe.py --output data/raw/a_share_securities.csv
```

The CSV records security code, exchange, board, listed-company name, security name, listing date, industry, region, source provider, retrieval time, and raw provider identifier useful for later screening.

Fetch the current Hong Kong listed equity security universe:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_hong_kong_universe.py --output data/raw/hong_kong_securities.csv
```

The Hong Kong CSV is security-level and keeps separate counters, share classes, and trading currencies as separate **Hong Kong Securities**.
